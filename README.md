# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine learning algorithm

Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia) and heart defects youâ€™re born with (congenital heart defects), among others.

Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality among the population of the world. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subjects in the section of clinical data science. The amount of data in the healthcare industry is huge. In this Project I have applied Machine Learning algorithm to classify whether a person is suffering from Heart Disease or not.
